*********************************
New Relic Instrumentation for Odoo
*********************************


Someone tells you, "Hey your site is being *slow* right now."
What do you do?  Restart Odoo? Look at Nginx access logs?  Could it be PostgreSQL?
We've all been there...

===========
Get Started
===========

1) Install the newrelic python package through pip or from source:

```
pip3 install newrelic
```

2) Create a newrelic.ini file `New Relic Python Quick Start <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-quick-start>`_ (you can skip if you'd rather use ENV variable, see (3) from below):

```
newrelic-admin generate-config YOUR_LICENSE_KEY /etc/odoo-newrelic.ini
```

3) Add this module to your existing addons folder or create a new addons folder and add it to the Odoo addons path.
4) Make sure that Odoo loads and uses your New Relic details which are usually set in a New Relic configuration file.
Add the New Relic configuration file to your **odoo-server.conf** file:

```
new_relic_config_file = /etc/odoo-newrelic.ini
# optionally you can set type of the environment "development", "test", "staging" or "production"
new_relic_environment = staging
# optionally set tracing level (default is odoo.models.BaseModel:limited)
new_relic_odoo_trace = odoo.models.BaseModel:public
```

Optionally you can set environment variables for the whole New Relic configuration. See `New Relic Python Agent Configuration <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#environment-variables>`_

Set environment variable **NEW_RELIC_ODOO_TRACE** to control what functions the module will purpusefully trace.

5) Restart your odoo process and install the 'newrelic' module in Odoo Apps. (You may need to restart your odoo server again and look at the logs for information about a misconfiguration or missing modules.)

Patching in newrelic's WSGI wrapper can fail if you are using other WSGI wrappers as well (`sentry` from OCA/server-tools is a known case) in combination with a threaded setup (no workers, as on Odoo.sh). In that case, try adding the module as a server wide module.

Features
========

* Web errors (like 404's) are not treated as errors.
* Server errors (like 500's) are caught and show up in the Errors area.
* Transactions are named by route.
* PostgreSQL and Python metrics are easily visible.
* Front end page metrics (page rendering) is enabled by default. (only on the front end)
* Works in threaded (workers=0) and multi process (workers>0) modes.
* Configurable function tracing with defaults for a subset of ORM Methods to preserve performance.

Known Issues
============

* Due to the nature of /longpolling, this transaction is ignored on purpose. (feature?)
* Background tasks are not profiled.
* Could probably use better transaction naming.
